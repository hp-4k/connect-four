Connect-four
============

This is a CLI Ruby implementation of the well-known [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game. It is a two-player game in which the players compete with each other to built a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line consisting of 4 disks of their colour.

The programme enables two human players to play Connect Four in the command line. The game was developed following Test Driven Development and Object Oriented design principles. Tests were written using RSpec and are saved in the spec directory.

The game was written as a final project for the "Testing Ruby with RSpec" section of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.
